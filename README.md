Master exercise
This game is inspired by the Harry Potter films. The story is totally invented by me, but the characters and the places are the same.
It's possible to test the room-swaping using the common arguments.

P.D. There's a pdf file in the repository where I show how I propose to create the game. I will finish it anyways, when I finally finish my final work degree.
